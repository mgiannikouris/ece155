%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Java Input/Output
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Java Input/Output}
In Java, Input/Output (or I/O) is modelled as a \textit{Stream}. \\
\vspace{1em}
A Stream is a sequence of data. \\
\vspace{1em}
A stream can be used to read data (input stream) or write data (output stream). \\
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% InputStream

\end{center}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Streams
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Streams}
The classes used to do I/O are descendants of the superclasses \texttt{InputStream} or \texttt{OutputStream}.  \\
\vspace{2em}
For example, to read from a file, use a \texttt{FileInputStream}.

\raggedright
This works, but it's really, really inefficient. Why? \\
\pause
\vspace{2em}
We are reading from / writing to the disk \textbf{one character (one byte) at a time} and that's really slow. \\
\pause
\vspace{2em}
What we'd often like to do is read a whole line at once. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Buffered Writer
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Buffered Writer}
Buffered output streams mean that output is kept in a buffer and only written to disk when the buffer is full. \\
\vspace{1em}
A crash might terminate execution before the buffer is written to disk and some of the expected output will not appear. \\
\vspace{1em}
To force the buffer to output its data, you can call \texttt{flush()}. \\
\vspace{1em}
Closing the stream also has the effect of flushing the buffer.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Other Kinds of Streams
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Other Kinds of Streams}
Java also has data streams and object streams, which are used for reading/writing/storing/loading more complex things. \\
\vspace{2em}
They are beyond the scope of this course.

% Events
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Events}
\Large
An \emph{event} is a notification of a change to the state of your system. \\
\vspace{2em}
\pause
\Large Reactive, not proactive.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section*{Event Listeners}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Event Listeners
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Event Listeners}
\begin{itemize}
\item To receive click events: \\
the application registers an event 
listener with the object representing the button.\\
\uncover<2>{\tt \qquad go.setOnClickListener(\ldots);}
\item When the user clicks the button: \\
the system executes the click event listener.
\end{itemize}

% Implementing Event Listeners (painfully)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Implementing Event Listeners (painfully)}
We need to pass something to {\tt setOnClickListener()}. What?\\[1em]

This method takes a {\tt View.OnClickListener} object.\\[1em]

You could declare one:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
class MyClickListener 
      extends View.OnClickListener {
  public void onClick(View v) {
    Log.d("A2", "clicked!");
  }
}
...
go.setOnClickListener(new MyClickListener()); 
\end{verbatim}
}

go.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {

}

{\Large This is called an \alert{inner class}.}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Advantages of Inner Classes}

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\footnotesize]
class MainActivity {
  int i;

  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    Button go = (Button) findViewById(R.id.go);
    final int j = 2;
    go.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
      public void onClick(View v) {
        Log.d("A2", "i is "+i+" and j is "+j);
      }
    }); 
  }
}
\end{Verbatim}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item They don't litter your code with one-time-use classes.
\pause
\item They can access fields and (final) local variables.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Alternative to Inner Classes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Alternative to Inner Classes}

You have another option. From the Android documentation\footnote{\tiny \url{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Button.html}}:
\begin{verbatim}
  <Button
     android:layout_height="wrap_content"
     android:layout_width="wrap_content"
     android:text="@string/self_destruct"
     android:onClick="selfDestruct" />
\end{verbatim}
\pause
Then, in your activity, you must include the method:
\begin{verbatim}
  public void selfDestruct(View view) {
     // Kaboom
  }
\end{verbatim}
\vspace{0.5em}
\end{frame}

\section*{Callback Methods}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Callback methods
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Callback methods}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Leveraging callback methods
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Leveraging Callback Methods}
You can also structure your program with callback methods.
Say you have a time-consuming task (TCT).\vfill
\begin{enumerate}
\item register a callback upon completion of TCT;
\item spawn the TCT in another thread, don't wait for it;
\item continue normally.
\end{enumerate}\vfill
Once the TCT finishes, the callback notifies the main application,
which collects results.\vfill
Also known as asynchronous, or non-blocking, execution.

% Synchronous versus Asynchronous Execution
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Synchronous versus Asynchronous Execution}
ECE155, ECE254: Asynchronous, or concurrent, programs:
\begin{itemize}
\item most instructions execute in sequence; but
\item main program may spawn a function to run concurrently with it.
\item Communication via shared memory or via events.
\end{itemize}
Permits higher performance on multicores, or more relevant structuring.
Callbacks are a tool.
