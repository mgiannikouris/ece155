	\begin{frame}{Definition}

		\begin{center}
			\begin{quote}
				A general-purpose definition of embedded systems is that they are
				devices used to control, monitor or assist the operation of equipment,
				machinery or plant. “Embedded” reflects the fact that they are an
				integral part of the system. In many cases, their “embeddedness” may
				be such that their presence is far from obvious to the casual observer.
				Even the more technically skilled might need to examine the operation
				of a piece of equipment for some time before being able to conclude
				that an embedded control system was involved in its functioning.

% Two Types of Embedded Systems
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Kinds of Embedded Systems}
\textbf{Embedded Systems} \\
\textit{Simple:} made of electronics, no processor or control software. \\ 
\textit{Complex:} has one or more processors along with control software. \\
\vspace{2em}
\textbf{Embedded Computer Systems} \\
A special-purpose computer system designed to perform a set of tasks without the user's knowledge of its existence. \\
\vspace{2em}
I like the distinction that an embedded system is \textbf{purpose-built}.

Designers of embedded computer systems face some challenges: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Limited processing power and memory
\item Potentially harsh operating environment
\item Hardware and platform variability
\item Limited or non-existent user interface
\item Minimal or non-existent operating system and APIs
\item Hard to access, service, and upgrade once they are deployed
